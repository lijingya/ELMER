\title{get.enriched.motif to identify the overrepresented motifs in a set of probes (HM450K) regions.}
\usage{
get.enriched.motif(probes.motif, probes, 
                   background.probes, lower.OR = 1.1, min.incidence = 10, 
                   dir.out = "./", label = NULL, save=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{probes.motif}{A matrix contains motifs occurrence within probes regions. Probes.motif in 
\pkg{ELMER.data} will be used if probes.motif is missing (detail see \code{\link{Probes.motif}}).}

\item{probes}{A vector lists the name of probes to define the set of probes in which motif enrichment
OR and confidence interval will be calculated.}

\item{lower.OR}{A number specifies the smallest lower boundary of 95\% confidence interval for Odds Ratio.
The motif with higher lower boudnary of 95\% confidence interval for Odds Ratio than the number 
are the significantly enriched motifs (detail see reference).}

\item{dir.out}{A path. Specifies the directory for outputs. Default is current directory}

\item{label}{A character. Labels the outputs such as "hypo", "hyper"}

\item{save}{If save is TURE, two files will be saved: getMotif.XX.enriched.motifs.rda and 
getMotif.XX.motif.enrichment.csv (see detail).}

\item{background.probesA}{vector lists name of probes which are considered as 
background for motif.enrichment  calculation (see detail).}

\item{min.incidenceA}{non-negative integer specifies the minimum incidence of motif in the given probes set. 
10 is default.}
}
\value{
A list contains enriched motifs with the probes regions harboring the motif.

A list (R object) with enriched motifs as name and probes containing the enriched 
  motif as contents. And hypo.motif.enrichment.pdf plot will be generated.
}
\description{
get.enriched.motif is a function make use of Probes.motif data from \pkg{ELMER.data}  
package to calculate the motif enrichment Odds Ratio and  95\% confidence interval for
a given set of probes. If save is TURE, two output files will be saved: 
getMotif.XX.enriched.motifs.rda and getMotif.XX.motif.enrichment.csv (see detail).
}
\details{
background.probes:
  For enhancer study, it is better to use probes within distal enhancer probes as
  background.probes. For promoter study, it is better to use probes within promoter
  regions as background.probes. Because enhancer and promoter have different CG content
  and harbors different clusters of TFs motif.
  
  save:
  if save is TRUE, two files will be save on the disk. The first file is 
  getMotif.XX.motif.enrichment.csv (XX depends on option label). This file reports 
  the Odds Ratio and 95\% confidence interval for these Odds Ratios which pass the 
  signficant cutoff (lower.OR and min.incidence). The second file is 
  getMotif.XX.enriched.motifs.rda (XX depends on option lable). This file contains
  a list R object with enriched motifs as name and probes containing the enriched 
  motif as contents. This object will be used in \code{\link{get.TFs}} function.
  if save is FALSE, the function will return a R object which is the same with second file.
