\title{ELMER analysis pipeline for TCGA data.}
\usage{
TCGA.pipe(disease, analysis = "all", wd = "./", cores = 1, Data = NULL,
  diff.dir = "hypo", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{disease}{TCGA short form disease name such as COAD}

\item{analysis}{A vector of characters listing the analysis need to be done.
Analysis can be "download","distal.probes","diffMeth","pair","motif","TF.search".
Default is "all" meaning all the analysis will be processed.}

\item{wd}{A path shows working dirctory. Default is "./"}

\item{cores}{A interger which defines number of core to be used in parallel process. 
Default is 1: don't use parallel process.}

\item{Data}{A path shows the folder containing DNA methylation, expression and clinic data}

\item{diff.dir}{A character can be "hypo" or "hyper", showing dirction DNA methylation changes.
If it is "hypo", get.diff.meth function will identify all significantly hypomethylated
CpG sites; If "hyper", get.diff.meth function will identify all significantly hypermethylated
CpG sites}

\item{...}{A list of parameters for functions: GetNearGenes, get.feature.probe, 
get.diff.meth, get.pair}
}
\value{
Different analysis results.
}
\description{
ELMER analysis pipeline for TCGA data. This pipeline combine every steps of \pkg{ELMER}
analyses: get.feature.probe, get.diff.meth, get.pair, get.permu, get.enriched.motif and get.TFs.
Every steps' results are saved.
